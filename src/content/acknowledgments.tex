My deepest gratitude to the mentors and friends who made this possible.

Greg Caporaso has been an ideal mentor and advisor, providing countless ideas
and opportunities, alongside the support, time, and encouragement I needed to
try, fail, learn, and grow as a developer, thinker, and individual.

Matt Dillon has served as a teacher and a role model, modeling how to learn,
to lead, and to live your values. He has impressed upon me the importance of
asking the right questions, investing in knowledge, standing up when you get
knocked down, and recognizing when the juice is just not worth the squeeze.

Evan Bolyen taught me what a stack frame was, after two years at University had
failed to do so. His advice on the important role ambition and failure can play
in personal and professional growth has been absolutely invaluable, and 
his unique combination of empathy, erudition, and fascination with the world
around him is a constant inspiration.

Anthony Simard and all of the other members of the Caporaso and Cope labs have
been the best friends, collaborators, and listening ears anyone could hope for.

Heidi Rodenhizer, my wife and partner, has shown me what it is to work happily
towards a goal, and has supported me through grad school while a PhD student
herself.

My parents, Cecilia Roehl and Bill Keefe, and my sister Kathleen, continue to
teach, motivate, and inspire me.
