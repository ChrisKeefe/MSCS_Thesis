QIIME 2-specific definitions of terms aggregated from the user \parencite{qiime_2_development_team_glossary_2016}
and developer documentation \parencite{qiime_2_development_team_glossary_2018}.
Definitions may be directly quoted, or may contain text combined from both pages.

\section*{Action}
\noindent A general term for a method, a visualizer, or a pipeline. Actions are always
defined by QIIME 2 plugins. Actions accept parameters and/or files (artifacts or
metadata) as input, and generate some kind of output.

\section*{Artifact}
\noindent Artifacts are QIIME 2 results that are generally considered to represent
intermediate data in an analysis, meaning that an artifact is generated by QIIME
2 and intended to be consumed by QIIME 2 (rather than by a human). Artifacts can
be generated either by importing data into QIIME 2 or as out from a QIIME 2
action. When written to file, artifacts typically have the extension .qza, which
stands for QIIME Zipped Artifact. Artifacts can be provided as input to QIIME 2
actions, loaded with tools such as the QIIME 2 Artifact API for use with Python
3 or qiime2R for use with R, or exported from QIIME 2 for use with other
software.

\section*{Metadata}
\noindent Columnar data for annotating additional values to existing data. Operates along
Sample IDs or Feature IDs.

\section*{Method}
\noindent A method accepts some combination of QIIME 2 artifacts and parameters as input,
and produces one or more QIIME 2 artifacts as output.

\section*{Parameter}
\noindent A primitive (i.e., non-artifact) provided to an action. A value that alters the
behavior of an action.

\section*{Pipeline}
\noindent A type of QIIME 2 action that typically combines two or more other actions. A
pipeline takes one or more artifacts or parameters as input, and produces one or
more results ( artifacts and/or visualizations) as output. For example, the
core-metrics action in the q2-diversity plugin is a pipeline.

\section*{Plugin}
\noindent A discrete module that registers some form of additional functionality with the
framework, including new methods, visualizers, formats, or transformers.

\section*{Result}
\noindent A general term for an artifact or a visualization.

\section*{Visualizer}
\noindent A type of QIIME 2 action that takes one or more artifacts or parameters as
input, and produces exactly one visualization as output. For example, the
summarize action in the q2-feature-table plugin is a visualizer.

\section*{Visualization}
\noindent Visualizations are QIIME 2 results that represent terminal output in an
analysis, meaning that they are generated by QIIME 2 and intended to be consumed
by a human (as opposed to being consumed by QIIME 2 or other software).
Visualizations can only be generated by QIIME 2 visualizers or pipelines. When
written to file, visualizations typically have the extension .qzv, which stands
for QIIME Zipped Visualization. Visualizations can be viewed with QIIME 2 View
[https://view.qiime2.org] on systems that donâ€™t have QIIME 2 installed, and
QIIME 2 interfaces typically provide their own support for viewing (such as the
qiime tools view command available through the QIIME 2 command line interface).
